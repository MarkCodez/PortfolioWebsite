			<p>What is Lorem Ipsum?
				Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

				Why do we use it?
				It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).


				Where does it come from?
				Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

				The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

				<h3>Languages</h3>

				<ul class="firstCol">
					<li>
						<h4>C/C++</h4>
						<p>
							C++ is my strong suit because of the exposure and hands-on-experience I've had with it. Through C++, I've gained a deep understanding
							of fundamental Computer Science principles, including diverse algorithms, data structures, and the core concepts of object-oriented
							programming.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Python</h4>
						<p>
							My Computer Science journey began with Python, which sparked my passion for coding. I earned my entry-level Python certificate in 2023
							after a Udemy course, showcasing my proficiency in the language. Python's simplicity and flexibility make it a language I enjoy
							working with when I can.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Java</h4>
						<p>
							The majority of my Java experience comes from developing Android apps. I completed a Java course in school that expanded my practical
							understanding of the language, by delving into creating small programs and GUI apps using JavaFX. I also got exposure to Eclipse,
							a different, Java specific IDE.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</h4>
						<p>
							My foundation in web development stems from online resources and constructing basic websites. I took an introductory web development course
							familiarizing me with essential concepts and serving as a launchpad for further growth.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

			</div>

			<div class="col-4">
				<h3>Tech tools</h3>

				<ul class="secondCol">
					<li>
						<h4>Version control: GitHub</h4>
						<p>
							I was introduced to version control tools and GitHub when I began collaborating on group projects. Using GitHub facilitated code sharing
							and concurrent work on various project features. This priceless tool improved our capabilities indivdually and as a team.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Android studio</h4>
						<p>
							In an effort to develop mobile apps, I familiarized myself with Android studio. I got hooked on it by creating simple apps with cool designs
							and eventually bought a Udemy course to learn about Android app dev from a professional. I've now crafted numerous applications independently
							and collaborated on team projects.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>VS Code/Visual Studio</h4>
						<p>
							I primarily use the VS Code IDE for programming tasks due to its lightweight nature, user-friendly interface, and widespread
							popularity. Although I've occasionally used Visual Studio for specific classes, my preference remains the VS Code IDE for programming.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Microsoft office suite</h4>
						<p>
							A simple but underestimated skill in my opinion, I've engaged in many of the services that Microsoft offers including Excel, Word,
							Access, etc. Whether it be for personal, school, or job work, I am familiar with using Microsoft office and enjoy its ease-of-use.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

			</div>

			<div class="col-4">
				<h3>Interpersonal skills</h3>

				<ul class="thirdCol">
					<li>
						<h4>Continuous learning mindset</h4>
						<p>
							I'm eager to learn about the latest technologies, always seeking their potential benefits. I'm highly adaptable, efficient at
							picking up new technologies, and embrace challenges. My experience at iCode, instructing youngsters, demanded rapid learning
							and adept teaching of diverse technologies in an engaging manner.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Effective communicator</h4>
						<p>
							I possess strong communication skills not only in the workplace but also in my daily interactions. I enjoy articulating my thoughts and
							ideas while actively listening to others' perspectives. Effective communication is essential for success, particularly when collaborating
							with diverse teams on different projects.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Teamplayer</h4>
						<p>
							Collaborating within a team has its challenges, a reality I've encountered in academic and professional settings. However, the
							success of a team lies in fostering a collective mindset. My team-first mindset stems from my ability to empathize
							with differing viewpoints, accommodating dissent, and compromising when necessary.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Leader</h4>
						<p>
							I've cultivated leadership qualities from my academic, professional, and personal experiences. I'm always driven, consistently taking 
							initiative in areas than can use improvement. My focus remains on results, setting an example by demonstrating the right approach rather than
							merely instructing others.
						</p>
